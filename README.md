# slideshow
Simple vanilla slideshow.

This is a simple slideshow with a video popup modal (click the last image for the example).  I have optimized for speed and reuse.

Design: I decided to keep the design simple and clean to devote more of the allotted time to the JS.  Although I spent more time than I care to admit on picking images and a theme for those images (try to guess - answer in HTML).  I think the end result came out nicely however.

Development: I went with code I know.  I’ve used all this code in various places for various things but maybe not all together like this.  I’m a little rusty so I spent too much time remembering how to make images do what I want only to find the key piece of advice I needed at the zero hour.  Horary! So it goes as Vonnegut would say.

TODO: I ran out of time before I could develop the dynamic code I wanted to use to load images and their related text (title and image count) from an external source as well as integrate image manipulation, storage and a pretty UI to let the user add more images.  I also ran out of time trying to implement swiping.  I have another branch here with my *almost* working version.  I figured a working MVP was better than a broken one.

V 1.0 ̶ Initial stable release.
